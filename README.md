Krellian Kiosk is a web runtime for interactive kiosks and digital signage.

It acts as both a web client (to render web content) and a web server (so that screens can be remotely managed over the internet).

## Getting Started

To get started hacking on Krellian Kiosk first make sure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

Clone the kiosk repository from GitHub:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/krellian/kiosk.git
$ cd kiosk
```

Install dependencies:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
$ npm install -g node-gyp
$ npm install
```
(commands may differ if you're not using a Debian-based Linux distribution)

Start the application:
```
$ npm start
```

The kiosk client should then start up full screen and the remote web interface should be running at http://localhost:8080

The web client uses Electron and the web server uses NodeJS.
